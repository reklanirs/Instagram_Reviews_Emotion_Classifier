#Drivetrain and #battery tech by CAKE. 
Commissioned by @wallpapermag

We rarely publish renders but when we do, it's something we’re excited being a part of!

Two exciting drivetrain projects, from partners we admire with concepts that go hand in hand with the CAKE mission: 
To accelerate and inspiring towards zero-emission while combining excitement with responsibility.

We're honored to be selected for these projects, supplying our technology to the concepts.
